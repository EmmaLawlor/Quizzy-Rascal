### Project Goals
#### As the Site Owner I Want to:
- Present a fun, interactive music quiz to the user.
- Provide the user with instructions/rules for playing the quiz.
- Give feedback to user when answer is selected, displaying both correct and incorrect options. 
- Display user's current score throughout the running of the quiz.

#### As the Site User I Want to:
- Play a fun and easy to use quiz to test music knowledge.
- Progress easily and intuitively through the quiz, with the option of returning to the homescreen at any point.
- Be informed whether chosen answer was correct or incorrect when selected.
- Be aware of current score while progressing through the quiz. 

### Design Choices

- Typography

- Colors

- Images

    - [Background Image](https://github.com/EmmaLawlor/quizzy-rascal/blob/main/assets/images/music-notes.jpg0) of black and white music notes chosen as it is in keeping with the musical theme of the quiz. The same image was used across all page of the site to maintain a sense of familiarity and to keep the overall layout simple and content-focused.
